This folder is for storing URLs and analyses. These are specific to the user and are created based on their inputs.
urls.json stores URLs and analysis.json stores property analyses. Initially this directory is empty
aside from this file ("Hello world") however the files will be added here once there is data to save.

DO NOT MODIFY ANY OF THE JSONs. It may cause unexpected behaviour. You may safely delete them however.
Though the program allows removing URLs individually from urls.json and automatically updates analysis.json.
