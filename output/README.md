This folder is for storing saved URLs, analyses, and errors.

These are specific to the user and are created based on their inputs.

urls.json stores URLs, analysis.json stores property analyses, and errors.log stores errors.

Initially this directory is empty aside from this file ("Hello world").

However, the files will be added here once there is data to save.


DO NOT MODIFY ANY OF THE JSONs. It may cause unexpected behaviour. You may safely delete them however.
Though the program allows removing URLs individually from urls.json and automatically updates analysis.json.

Use errors.log for troubleshooting. Usually there will be a unique case not considered by the get_property_info.py web scraper.
