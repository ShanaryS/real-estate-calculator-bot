This folder contains all files relating to the output of the program.

These are specific to the user and are thus created at runtime as necessary.

urls.json stores URLs, analysis.json stores property analyses, and errors.log logs errors.

Initially this directory is empty aside from this file ("Hello world :)").

However, the files will be added here once there is data to save.


DO NOT MODIFY ANY OF THE JSONs, INCLUDING DELETING EITHER JSON. It may cause unexpected behaviour. You may safely delete both at once however.
Though the program allows removing URLs individually from urls.json and automatically updates analysis.json so there is really no need to.

Use errors.log for troubleshooting. Usually there will be a unique case not considered by the get_property_info.py web scraper.
