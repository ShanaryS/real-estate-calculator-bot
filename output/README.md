This folder is for storing URLs and analysis. These are specific to the user and are created based on their inputs.
urls.json stores URLs and analysis.json stores property analyses. Initially this directory is empty
aside from this file ("Hello world") however the files will be added here once there is data to save.

DO NOT MODIFY ANY OF THESE FILES. You may safely delete them. Though program allows removing URLs individually
from urls.json and automatically updates analysis.json. So there isn't any need to.
