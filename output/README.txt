This folder is where URLs and analysis are stored. These are specific to the user and are created based on their inputs.
URLs are stored in urls.json and property analysis are stored in analysis.json. Initially this directory is empty
aside from this file (hi) but the files will be added here once there is data to save.

DO NOT MODIFY ANY OF THESE FILES. You may safely delete them. Though program allows removing URLs individually
from urls.json and automatically updates analysis.json. So there isn't any need to.
